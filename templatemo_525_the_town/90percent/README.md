# 90percent-vue

## How to Play

You will be presented with 10 quantitative questions and asked to provide an range in which you believe the answer lies. The questions are tough though, and it will be hard to get the questions right without giving a really big window.

But that's OK!

This is a game to test how well you can judge your own confidence. The range you provide should be a "90-percent confidence interval." That is to say, you should only be 90% confident that the answer lies in the range, and on average
you should only get 90% of the questions correct. Thus the closer you are to getting 1 out of 10 wrong, the better you're doing!

And that's all there is to it. When you're ready to play, simply right click on 'index.hmtl' and click 'open' with your favorite browser.
